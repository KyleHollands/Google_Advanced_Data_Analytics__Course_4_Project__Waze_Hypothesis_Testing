# Google_Advanced_Data_Analytics__Course_4_Project__Waze_Hypothesis_Testing

For this part of the project, descriptive statistics were generated, followed by a two-sample t-test to assess whether the average number of drives per device type (iPhone vs. Android) differed significantly. This test was appropriate because the two groups were independent, the population standard deviations were unknown, and the variables exhibited right-skewness.

The test results indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in the mean number of drives between the two device types. Consequently, we failed to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.
